Making right use of data structures and algorithms.
The assignments from "Data structures and algorithms" specialization course from University of San Diego are under
the UCSC folder. Make sure of understanding assignments and then implementing it with your own code. Cheers!

Important algorithms: </br>
1.)  Greedy algorithms: As the name suggests, these algorithms are greedy at each step and try to get the best at each step.
                        So they always make locally optimal decision. This may not always lead to the correct solution.
                        Eg: Largest number formed from '3', '7', '8', '5'  => will be 8753.  With greedy technique, at each 
                        stage it finds the largest i.e. 8, then 7, then 5, then 3.
